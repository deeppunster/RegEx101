# RegEx101

This project contains the training materials used for a regular expressions in Python session at the 2016 PyOhio conference.  For details, see www.pyohio.org.

This training is based on using Jupyter notebooks for the training.

The exercises are based on the coverage of regular expressions in the book "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" by Al Sweigart.

The presentation file - Regular Expressions.pdf - was used for the lecture portion of the session.

The Python program PlayParse.py shows an extended example of how to create a complex regular expression that can be understood by someone else without a lot of effort.
